# Datasets

This page lists all CEQR Data Hub datasets and which CEQR analytical chapters they're applicable to.

For all datasets available for download, the [Dataset Versions csv file](https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/ceqr-data-hub/latest/dataset_versions.csv) lists the current version of the data. If the source of the data doesn't provide a version, the date it was accessed is used.

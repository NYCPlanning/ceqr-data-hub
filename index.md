# CEQR Data Hub

The CEQR Data Hub is a product of the NYC Department of City Planning and intended to house datasets related to New York City's Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) process. It brings together various tabular, geospatial, and qualitative data resources from city, state, and federal sources to help applicants locate the most up to date resources to conduct their environmental reviews. Applicants should prepare their environmental analyses in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the [CEQR Technical Manual](https://www.nyc.gov/site/oec/environmental-quality-review/technical-manual.page), but will find many of the resources needed on this page. All datasets can either be downloaded from links available on this site or through the links made available to external webpages.

For more information about environmental review, please visit the following pages:

- [Department of City Plannings Environmental Review Process](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/applicants/environmental-review-process.page)

For all datasets available for download, the [Dataset Versions csv file](to-do.com) lists the current version of the data. If the source of the data doesnâ€™t provide a version, the date it was accessed is used.

If you are having issues utilizing this data or would like to request that additional data be posted, please contact the Capital and Planning Support team (CAPS) at <caps@planning.nyc.gov>.

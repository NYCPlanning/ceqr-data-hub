# CEQR Data Hub

The CEQR Data Hub is intended to house datasets related to the [environmental review process](https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/applicants/environmental-review-process.page) for prospective land use applicantions considered by the New York City Planning Commission.

Applicants prepare their environmental analyses in accordance with the methodologies set forth in the [CEQR Technical Manual](https://www.nyc.gov/site/oec/environmental-quality-review/technical-manual.page).

All datasets can either be downloaded here or are avaiable from an external webpage.

For all datasets available for download, the [Dataset Versions csv file](to-do.com) lists the current version of the data. If the source of the data doesn't provide a version, the date it was accessed is used.
